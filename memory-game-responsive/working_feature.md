**How I got it to Work**:

This one was a real pain. Because of the multiple prompting the person used to make this, there css was a mess. Sometimes some styling was applied to certain elements up to 3 times. So I had chatGPT clean it up, but then I tried to fix it myself. I started by adding a constant pixel buffer from the edges of the screen. Then I turned the body into a flexbox, and put a bunch of flexboxes everywhere inside of it. The grid got it's own container, and would scale beautifully with the width, but not the height. This drove me absolutely nuts for hours. Eventually I found some hacky way to make it work. By not making the grid aspect ratio 1:1, it would stick to the given width and height. Although, I would've rather had it stay 1:1, and just fit into the box by either filling up the entire width, or entire height, depending on which was smaller.
